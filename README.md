# Transactional-Email-Template-
A transactional email template for a burger restaurant. 
Desigs were created using canva. Please see below for a snip of what the email looks like. See the master branch for code. Style tags were used for the CSS but a CSS inliner (campaign monitor) will be utilized when testing and deploying the email. Please use the following live link for a preview of the project. https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JakeD57/Transactional-Email-Template-/blob/master/index.html
